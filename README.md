Assignment
In this project, you'll be using your HTML and CSS knowledge to build your first static site from scratch! You'll be creating a website for a person in your community who wants to launch an endeavor but isn't a coder themselves. 

As a developer, you'll often have the chance to be involved in cool projects by building websites for interesting and unique clients!

Let's meet the client. Jennifer Viala is the founder of Brooklyn Vibes Events Co. and is also the organizer of this yearâ€™s Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival. She hopes to select and show films from August 5th to 8th at Brooklyn Bridge Park, a major entertainment venue in New York that can hold up to 5,000 people. ðŸŒ‰

She wants to create an event that shows that films can appeal to audiences of all ages, and she wants her advertisements and publications to reflect that same idea!

Jennifer has a budget of $3,500 to get the event website up and running. She needs to communicate online about her festival in order to announce the upcoming showings and take reservations!

Project to-dos
1. Website prototype
You'll need to make a first version of the site that meets all the requirements Jennifer explained above. The website prototype should be in HTML and CSS with Bootstrap. You don't actually need to buy the .com or the .org though; you can simply propose it in your project brief.

The pre-registration page doesn't need to be functional. It should be a simple page with a form that doesn't actually submit data to a real codebase.

The webpage you build can be a local set of HTML and CSS files on your computer. There's no need to host or deploy the site.

2. Project brief
Make your communication with the client easier by writing a document that puts you both on the same page! ðŸ™Œ In it, you'll cover logistical details about the overall project as well as technical details about the website you create.

Create a project brief from the description above and the clientâ€™s requests. It must have the following elements:

Summary
Stakeholders
Goals
Budget
Timeline
Technical specifications (explanation of design and technical choices that were made, even if they're basic)
